# Project Codebase Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the `swift-bus-reservation` project's codebase structure and the purpose of its main components.

## Core Technologies

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MySQL (managed with Sequelize ORM)
*   **Templating Engine:** Pug (formerly Jade)
*   **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO
*   **Mobile Integration:** Capacitor (for Android/iOS builds)

## Directory Structure and Purpose

*   `app.js`: The main Express application setup, where middleware and routes are configured.
*   `server.js`: The entry point of the application, responsible for starting the HTTP server, database synchronization, Socket.IO setup, and cron jobs.
*   `.env`: Environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., database credentials, JWT secrets).
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore by Git.
*   `config/`: Contains configuration files, such as `config.js` for database connection details.
*   `controller/`: Houses the application's business logic. Each controller handles requests related to a specific resource (e.g., `authController.js` for authentication, `busController.js` for bus-related operations).
    *   `controller/admin_panel/`: Controllers specifically for the admin panel functionalities.
*   `model/`: Defines the database schemas and models using Sequelize. `index.js` typically sets up the database connection and relationships.
    *   `model/model/userModel.js`: Defines the user table schema.
    *   `model/testData/`: May contain sample or test data for the database.
*   `node_modules/`: Contains all the third-party libraries and dependencies installed via npm.
*   `public/`: Serves static assets like images, JavaScript files, and CSS stylesheets.
    *   `public/images/`: Stores various images used in the application, including icons.
    *   `public/js/`: Client-side JavaScript files for interactive functionalities (e.g., `login.js`, `home.js`, `Search_Result.js`).
    *   `public/plugin/`: Third-party JavaScript libraries (e.g., Axios, jQuery, Leaflet).
    *   `public/style/`: CSS files for styling the application.
*   `route/`: Defines the API endpoints and maps them to the respective controller functions (e.g., `userRoute.js`, `busRouter.js`).
*   `services/`: Contains utility functions or services that can be shared across different parts of the application (e.g., `multer.js` for file uploads).
*   `uploads/`: Directory for storing uploaded files, such as bus images or profile pictures.
*   `utils/`: General utility functions (e.g., `catchAsync.js` for error handling, `socketHandler.js` for Socket.IO related utilities).
*   `views/`: Contains the Pug template files that render the HTML pages.
    *   `views/admin_pannel/`: Pug templates for the admin dashboard and related pages.
    *   `views/Conductor/`: Templates for conductor-specific views.
    *   `views/headers/`: Reusable Pug partials for headers and navigation.
    *   `views/payment/`: Templates related to payment processing.
    *   `views/user/`: Templates for user-facing pages (e.g., `home.pug`, `Search_Result.pug`).
*   `android/`: Contains Android-specific project files generated by Capacitor.

This structure promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more organized and maintainable.
